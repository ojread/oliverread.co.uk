## Strategy

Rather than use a traditional monolithic CMS to do everything, break the process down into individual services that talk to each other.

Follow the [Twelve-factor app methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-Factor_App_methodology)

## Technologies in use

* React
* Gatsby.js
* Bulma
* Netlify CMS
* Netlify CDN

### Content

Content is currently stored in the repo as Markdown files. These are editable through Netlify CMS.

Another option would be to use a CMS like Cockpit or Drupal and pull in content through their APIs.

### Templates

### Build

### Deploy

### Host
